# Zelda64 version comparison scripts

TODO: write description

N.B. Support for Animal Forest is quite limited at present, but is being actively worked on.

## Python dependencies

First you'll need to create a virtual environment for the python packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

To start using the virtual environment on your current terminal run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Take in mind for each new terminal you'll need to **active** the Python virtual
environment again, there's no need to create the virtual environment again.

Now you can install the Python dependencies, to do so run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

- Each ROM you wish to extract for comparison should be named `{game}/{game}_{version}.z64`.
- (Optional) Run `fixbaserom.py` for every version just to be sure: the roms are expected to be big-endian.
- Run `make setup GAME={game} VERSION={version}` for every version you wish to compare to extract the baseroms to separate decompressed files, e.g.

  ```bash
  make setup GAME=mm VERSION=ne0
  ```

  will extract MM's US N64 version (see the bottom of the README.md for the abbreviations this repository uses)

  <!-- - `extract_every_baserom.sh` will try to extract every known version, and ignore the missing ones (This will take a while...). -->

- Run `make GAME={game} VERSION={version}` to disassemble.

## Usage

- If you update a Google sheet, `make downloadcsvs` will pull the sheets for the corresponding game (specify it with `GAME=`).
- Rerunning `make` with the appropriate variables set will re-disassemble with the new symbols.
- To change the files that are extracted, edit the appropriate game's `disasm_list.txt`. By default only a few files are diassembled to save time.

N.B. DnM overlays are not currently supported since the relocation section is separate.

## Version abbreviations

Because OoT has over 20 different versions, and MM 10, it's necessary to have short abbreviations for each version when comparing. The first two letters are mostly from Nintendo's designations, for media

- `N` is cartridge
- `C` is disc

and for regions

- `J` is Japan
- `E` is America
- `P` is PAL (Australia as well as Europe, at least in this case)

The following tables give the more common name/description of each version:

### OoT
